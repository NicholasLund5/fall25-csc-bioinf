# Deliverable 2 - Steps, Key changes, and test coverages

### Steps

1. **Initialize repo and analyze BioPython source**
   * *Gotcha:* Bio.motifs has complex inheritance patterns that don't work in Codon

2. **Start with core Motif class conversion**
   * *Gotcha:* Property decorators aren't supported—had to rewrite as get_/set_ methods

3. **Handle matrix storage patterns**
   * *Gotcha:* Dict inheritance doesn't work. Switched to Dict[str, List[float]] composition

4. **Replace numpy/scipy dependencies**
   * *Gotcha:* No scientific libraries available. Had to implement log, exp, stats manually

5. **Convert matrix classes (Generic, Frequency, Weight, Scoring)**
   * *Gotcha:* List comprehensions unsupported. Rewrote everything as explicit loops

6. **Port MEME parser with manual string processing**
   * *Gotcha:* Regex not available. Used basic split/strip operations instead

7. **Implement threshold calculations**
   * *Gotcha:* Dynamic programming needed careful manual implementation

8. **Write comprehensive tests**
   * *Gotcha:* Had to adapt BioPython's test patterns to work without unittest framework

9. **Debug type annotations and compilation errors**
   * *Gotcha:* Spent significant time fixing variable declaration order and type mismatches

## `Bio.motifs.__init__`
