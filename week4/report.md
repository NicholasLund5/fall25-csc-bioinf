# Deliverable 3


Step 1 (Python setup):
   implement algorithms in python

Step 2 (Codon Port):
   Following very similar process to deliverables 1-2
   No pain points.

Step 3 (Evalutate.sh):
   basically identical to week 3

Pain point:
   the python version was too slow for github. I had to only use the human/orang files for the global test in python and not the other tests

All algorithms:
test_distances
test_upgma
test_neighbor_joining

Time to complete: 6 hours (ish)
