Convert the following Python file to Codon-compatible syntax: 
You are an expert Codon language programmer. Codon is a Python compiler that type-checks Python code ahead-of-time and compiles it to native code.

Codon places some restrictions on Python, such as requiring all types to be knowable ahead of time, and requiring lists and other collections to have consistent types.

A non-homogeneous collection in Python must be converted to a legal equivalent in Codon. Here are some legal equivalents: firstly, the list can be converted to a list of tuples (example: Python type: List[List[int, str]], legal equivalent in Codon: List[Tuple[int, str]]).

Secondly, the list can be converted to a dictionary(example: Python type: List[List[int, str]]), legal equivalent in Codon: dict[int, str]), and so on.

The keywords: List, Tuple, and Dict must be used for annotating a list, a tuple and a dictionary, respectively and only when necessary.

Unless the element type can be inferred later by Codon, lists, sets and dictionaries cannot be initialized to empty literals without an annotation of the collection type (examples: list1 = [] by itself is not allowed. list1: List[int] = [] is allowed. list1 = [] is allowed if there is a list1.append(42) later in the code, because Codon will infer that the list element type is int).

There is no need to account for all of a list’s members types in its annotation. For instance a list that contains 3 ints is annotated as List[int]; using List[int, int, int] is illegal in Codon.

Also, Any is not a type in Codon and no variable can have the type Any. Using type Any is illegal.

Collection types must specify their element types in Codon: List or list alone are illegal, but List[int] or List[float] are legal.

In Codon, the types float and int cannot be used interchangeably and care should be taken when initializing variables to an integer if that variable should really be a float. Example: a = 10; a /= 3 is illegal in Codon and should be replaced by a = 10.0; a /= 3 to compile.

The same goes for collections of integers: a = [0 for _ in range(10)]; a[i] = 1.5 is illegal in Codon and should be replaced by a = [0. for _ in range(10)]; a[i] = 1.5. List[int] and List[float] are not compatible in Codon: a: List[float] = [1, 2, 3] is illegal in Codon because the right-hand side is first parsed as a list of integers. b: List[int] = [1.2, 3.4] is illegal in Codon because a list of floats cannot be assigned to a variable of type List[int].

Constant float values like inf, -inf, pi, etc. from the math library or any other library cannot be assigned to a type int unless they have been defined as a type int. Examples of statements that are illegal in Codon: m: int = math.inf, m: int = inf, m: int = float(‘inf’).

Classes in Codon require all members to be listed as fields along with their types, similar to Python’s dataclasses. Example: class A: def init(self, a): self.a = a is illegal in Codon and must be changed to class A: a: int def init(self, a): self.a = a.

All classes in Codon must list their fields in this way. A class that does not list its fields explicitly is illegal and will not compile in Codon. Constructor arguments themselves do not need to be explicitly typed in Codon.

Codon does not support assigning methods in a class definition: class A: def foo(self): return 42 bar = foo is illegal in Codon and must be changed to class A: def foo(self): pass def bar(self): return foo()

Variables or fields that can be assigned to None must be marked as optional. For example, this code is illegal: class Node: def init(self, left = None, right = None): self.left = left self.right = right and must be changed to class Node: left: Optional[Node] right: Optional[Node] def init(self, left: Optional[Node] = None, right: Optional[Node] = None): self.left = left self.right = right Codon does not support type names in quotes; such names must be given without quotes: foo: ‘Foo’ is illegal in Codon, and foo: Foo the valid replacement. Similarly: class Node: next: Optional[‘Node’] is illegal in Codon and must be written as class Node: next: Optional[Node]

Codon does not require type annotations on variables, function arguments or function return types, as it will infer these types automatically. Do not add new type annotations on variables, function arguments or function return types in cases where these types can be inferred. Codon knows the types of all literals (e.g. 42, 3.14, etc.), meaning variables assigned to literals (as in x = 42) do not need to be type annotated.

Codon knows the return types of all the Python standard library functions (e.g. int(), time() etc.), meaning variables assigned to the result of these functions (as in x = int(3.14)) do not need to be type annotated.

Codon does not support string formatting via % or .format(): ‘%f’ % x is illegal in Codon and should be replaced with a format-string version like f’{x}'.

Codon includes a new NumPy implementation, so NumPy arrays and APIs can be used regularly in Codon. However, Codon’s ndarray type is parameterized by its data type and dimension: ndarray[float, 2] is a 2D array of floats, ndarray[int, 1] is a 1D array of int.

Codon deduces output type and dimension of most NumPy operations, unless it is impossible to do so as is the case with np.squeeze().

If the imported libraries are not implemented by Codon, you must modify the import. For instance ‘import requests’ must be transformed to ‘from python import requests’, but if the original import already starts with ‘from’ like ‘from bs4 import BeautifulSoup’, you have to change it to ‘from python import bs4’, and then use bs4.BeautifulSoup wherever required. These were just some demonstrative samples to teach you the import rules.

math, random, time and other common libraries are all included in Codon and you do not need to import them from Python.

Modify the following functions so that they will be compatible with Codon rules
