Here’s a cleaner, slightly polished version for your README while keeping it concise and informal:

### Steps

1. **Initialize repo**

2. **Get Python script working**

   * *Gotcha:* Initially ran into issues installing `matplotlib`, but realized it wasn’t needed—saved some troubleshooting time.

3. **Calculate N50**

   * *Gotcha:* Tried calculating all table data at first, but that required a reference genome we didn’t have. This was before the Piazza comment was added, so some time was wasted here.

4. **Put steps into a Bash script**

5. **Create Codon files**

   * *Gotcha:* Figuring out unsupported libraries took a while. Solved it by brute-forcing and handling compile errors one at a time.

6. **Add Codon execution to Bash files**
